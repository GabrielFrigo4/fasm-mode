# fasm-mode
`fasm-mode` is a major mode for editing [FASM][fasm] x86 assembly
programs. It includes syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, and
imenu integration. Unlike Emacs' generic `asm-mode`, it understands
FASM-specific syntax. Requires Emacs 24.3 or higher.

The keyword lists are up to date as of FASM 1.73.32.
